In the name god


this app is designed to run on arduino in my case it was mega 2560 

3 other modules used to get it to work a nokia 5110 minotr a 4x4 keypad
and a buzzer to produce sound

it was simple but bugs and errors appear to come from nowhere 
so sometimes it take more time than you think to debug!
